# Intramolecular Entropy

This is the python code to compute the intramolecular entropy of a molecule using the Schlitter quasi-harmonic approach.
It is a serial code which makes use of NumPy for most of the numerical calculations. Works with Python version 3.6. The input files have the same format as those obtained from LAMMPS software.
